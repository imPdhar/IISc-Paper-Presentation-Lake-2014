# LAKE 2014- IISc. Paper Presentation 

This is the team from [Prarthana School](http://www.prarthanaschool.in/) that stood first nationwide and everyone were allotted different roles like survey and speech, I was given the opportunity to acquire data from surveys, research and finally make the presentation. As a 14 year old, this was nothing I had dreamt of and was a delight to work on this.

On the account of winning, we were given the opportunity from IISc. to speak to the municipalities whichever controlled the lakes and we were featured in the newspaper for the same and raising awareness.
